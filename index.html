                                Hello! My name is Dylan Kraft and I am a student at the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/" target=”_blank”>University 
                                of St. Thomas</a> studying Computer Science. I am also minoring in Data Analytics, 
                                Digital Media Art, and Film Studies. I am currently in my third year 
                                of college and I have taken several computer science courses such as Algorithms, 
                                Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, and Web Development. In my spare time, 
                                I enjoy art, movies, video games, and spending time with friends. I am also involved with 
                                several clubs and activities on campus including my role as Marketing Chair of the Tabletop 
                                Gaming Club, and member of the Computer Science and Badminton clubs.
                                <br>&emsp;The past two summers,  I have had the opportunity to work as a software engineer 
                                at <a href="https://calspan.com/" target="_blank">Calspan ASE</a> in downtown St. Paul. I started there as an intern in Summer 2022, and 
                                was hired back at the end of the summer. I continued to work there as a part-time employee 
                                during the 2022-2023 school year, and then returned to full time hours for summer 2023.
                                <br>&emsp;During my time at Calspan, my main project was working on a Python script to automate the creation of 
                                PDF reports from some data files and Excel templates on the company's Linux environment. I spent 
                                first summer creating this script, then worked on implementing the script to work within the existing 
                                environment so the team could start using it. In addition to this main project, I also worked on 
                                developing UI screens in conjunction with the other two software interns.
